                    <li>To prepare the naan dough, mix the yogurt, flour, salt and baking powder together. If you have self raising flour, you can leave out the baking powder.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a pan. Add the chopped onion and ginger garlic paste. Allow the onions to soften.</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes into cubes, and put them into a pan with water 100ml to boil and become soft.</li>
                    <li>Add the mince of choice, and allow this to brown. Once browned, you can add all the spices to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Add any additional vegatables. I chose potatoes in this case, then mix the vegetables with the mince. Switch off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                    <li>To assemble the naan, roll out the dough into small balls, then roll into a circle. If it's too sticky, add more flour.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp of the mince mixture onto the rolled out dough. Spread it out leaving space around the edges.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, comibine the remaining flour and water to make a paste.</li>
                    <li>Using this paste, we can seel the naan. Roll out another dough ball, and place this on the topÂ of the naan, whilst seeling it with the paste.</li>
                    <li>Using a pan, apply 1 tbsp oil if needed and cook the naan both sides till golden, then serve.</li>
